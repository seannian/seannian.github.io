        <p class="introduction">
            I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am working on user-centric ML systems advised by <a href="https://www.fanlai.me/">Prof. Fan Lai</a>. 
            I am very fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program">2025 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP)</a>.

        <p class="introduction">
            My research interests are broadly in the intersection of distributed systems, computer networks, and machine learning.
            I am currently working on systems for machine learning.
            If you are interested in learning more about my work, feel free to reach out.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
            Before starting my PhD, I spent time in the automotive industry as an R&D Software Engineering Intern at the PACCAR Innovation Center, where I developed edge-to-cloud data pipelines for commercial vehicle systems.
            Even before that, I graduated from San Jose State University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Honors. 
            I had the privilege of being advised by <a href="https://sjsu-interconnect.github.io/members/genya_ishigaki/">Prof. Genya Ishigaki</a> and <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/people/ben.reed/">Prof. Ben Reed</a>. 
            Additionally, I conducted research with <a href="https://artpad6.github.io/">Prof. Arthi Padmanabhan</a> at Harvey Mudd College as part of an NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU).
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
            As a first-generation student, I am committed to keeping the door open for those who come after me. 
            If you're a student navigating a similar path, interested in my work, want to collaborate, or need advice, I am always happy to help. 
            Please don't hesitate to reach out.
            I keep a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Blog-259bdee4cf61802b8359e131bd97af0a?source=copy_link">blog</a> for fun.
